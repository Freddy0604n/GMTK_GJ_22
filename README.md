# GMTK Game Jam 2022 entry

This is a game completely created in Rust to try out creating games in rust. Currently the topic is unknown, so further information is unnecesary.

Edit:
This evolved into me trying out the graphics library I wanted to use for the project, so in the git log you can find a snake game, and potentially
other things that I will try out in the future.
